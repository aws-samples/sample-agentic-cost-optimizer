# Archived Kiro Specs

This directory contains archived Kiro specifications (specs) from earlier stages of development.

## What are Kiro Specs?

Kiro specs are structured artifacts used by the [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev) that formalize feature development through three key documents:
- `requirements.md` - Feature requirements using EARS syntax
- `design.md` - Technical design and architecture
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks and subtasks

These specs bridge the gap between high-level product ideas and technical implementation. Learn more in the [Kiro Specs documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/).

## Purpose of This Archive

These specs are preserved for:
- Historical record of how features were originally designed
- Reference for understanding architectural decisions
- Learning how certain features were built

## Important Note

**These specs may be outdated.** They were generated as the codebase evolved and may not reflect the current implementation. Refer to the actual source code and current documentation for accurate information.
